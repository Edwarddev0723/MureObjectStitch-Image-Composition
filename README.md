# MureObjectStitch-Image-Composition

MureObjectStitch is a simple extension of [ObjectStitch](https://github.com/bcmi/ObjectStitch-Image-Composition) to support multiple reference images of foreground object. Generally speaking, more reference images lead to better results. 

You can also finetune MureObjectStitch using a few images of the foreground object for better detail preservation. 



MureObjectStitch has been integrated into our image composition toolbox [libcom](https://github.com/bcmi/libcom).

The full code including the finetuning code will be released soon.
